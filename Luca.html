                    <p>Luca draws inspiration from Casarosa's childhood in Genoa, Italy. Several 
                        Pixar artists were sent to the Italian Riviera gathering research from Italian 
                        culture and environment to create Portorosso, the primary setting. The sea monsters, 
                        a "metaphor for feeling different", were loosely based on old Italian regional myths 
                        and folklore.[3][4] As with the short film La Luna (2011), the design and animation

                    <p>Luca premiered at the Aquarium of Genoa on June 13, 2021,[6] and was released direct-to-streaming 
                        on Disney+ in the United States on June 18, 2021 in response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. 
                        It was released in theaters in countries without the streaming service, and given a simultaneous 
                        one-week theatrical run at Hollywood's El Capitan Theatre, from June 18 to 24, 2021</p>
