                    <p class="reviewer">Odin's vault. </p>
                    <p>Two years after the Battle of Sokovia,[a] Thor is imprisoned 
                        by the fire demon Surtur, who reveals that Thor's father Odin 
                        is no longer on Asgard. He explains that the realm will soon be 
                        destroyed during the prophesied apocalypse Ragnarök, once Surtur 
                        unites his crown with the Eternal Flame that burns in Odin's vault. 
                        Thor frees himself, defeats Surtur, and takes his crown, believing he 
                        has prevented Ragnarök. Thor returns to Asgard to find Heimdall gone and 
                        his estranged brother Loki posing as Odin. He forces Loki to help find t
                        heir father, who Loki put a spell on after his presumed sacrifice years.</p>
