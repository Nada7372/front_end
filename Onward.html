                    <h3>That is nothing short of extraordinary</h3>
                    <p class="reviewer">Liam McLeon</p>
                    <p>Onward premiered at the 70th Berlin International Film Festival 
                        on February 21, 2020, and was theatrically released in the United 
                        States on March 6, 2020. The film received generally positive reviews 
                        from critics, but underperformed at the box office, grossing $142 million 
                        worldwide against its between $175–200 million budget. The COVID-19 pandemic 
                        contributed to its financial shortcomings, due to the widespread closure of 
                        theaters. Like several other films released in the early months of 2020</p>
